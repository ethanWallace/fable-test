          <p className="mb-400">The earliest description of what we call cupcake was found in 1796, within a recipe written by Amelia Simmons, describing a light cake to bake in small cups. And this is it. A website with only light and good things in it. Take a look at this list of beautiful cupcake recipes. Even better, let us know which cupcake recipe you enjoy best, upload your own, and treat yourself with an order of your favorite ones.</p>
